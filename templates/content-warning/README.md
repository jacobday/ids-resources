# How to use

## Setup

1. From [index.html](./index.html), copy ``` <div class="content-warning"> ``` (lines 30 to 34) into the container or figure you would like to hide
1. Copy the styling from [contentWarning.css](./assets/css/contentWarning.css) into your stylesheet
1. Copy [content_warning.js](./assets/js/content_warning.js) into your project

## Notes

- Set the parent element containing ``` <div class="content-warning"> ``` to ``` position: relative ```.  The content warning will now be the same height/width as the parent.
